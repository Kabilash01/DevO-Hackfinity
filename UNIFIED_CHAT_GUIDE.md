## 🏁 **Getting Started**

### **1. Quick Start**
```bash
# Start the unified chat assistant
uv run python chat.py --repo-path .

# Or use the Windows batch file
.\chat.bat
```

### **2. Environment Setup**
Make sure your API key is configured:
```bash
# Set environment variable
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Or create .env file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

### **3. First Conversation**
The assistant will:
1. Automatically analyze your repository
2. Display repository overview (language, framework, files)
3. Start the chat interface
4. Wait for your questions or requests

## 💬 **How to Use**

### **Natural Conversation Examples**

Instead of specific commands, just chat naturally:

```
You: What issues do you see in my code?
DevO: I'll analyze your Python repository for potential issues...

You: How can I improve the performance of this app?
DevO: Based on your Flask application, here are performance optimizations...

You: Help me containerize this Python application
DevO: I'll help you create a Docker setup for your project...

You: What dependencies am I missing?
DevO: Scanning your imports and requirements...

You: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
DevO: I'll check your dependencies and code for security issues...

You: How do I optimize this for production?
DevO: Here are production optimization recommendations...
```

### **Quick Commands**
Simple shortcuts for common tasks:
- `help` - Show comprehensive help
- `context` - Display repository information
- `clear` - Clear chat history
- `exit` - Exit the chat

## 🔧 **Advanced Features**

### **Session Management**
```bash
# Save your conversation
uv run python chat.py --repo-path . --save-session my_session.json

# Load previous conversation
uv run python chat.py --repo-path . --load-session my_session.json
```

### **Different Repository**
```bash
# Analyze different repository
uv run python chat.py --repo-path /path/to/other/repo
```

### **Custom API Key**
```bash
# Use specific API key
uv run python chat.py --repo-path . --api-key your_key_here
```

## 🎨 **What Makes It Unified**

### **Before (Old Approach)**
```bash
# Multiple separate commands
uv run python repo_containerizer.py analyze
uv run python repo_containerizer.py suggest
uv run python repo_containerizer.py check_deps
uv run python repo_containerizer.py chat
```

### **After (Unified Approach)**
```bash
# One command, natural conversation
uv run python chat.py --repo-path .

# Then just chat naturally:
"What issues do you see?"
"Help me with dependencies"
"How to containerize this?"
"Suggest improvements"
```

## 📊 **What Gets Analyzed Automatically**

The assistant automatically understands:

- **🔤 Language**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.
- **🚀 Framework**: Flask, Django, React, Next.js, etc.
- **📦 Package Manager**: pip, npm, yarn, etc.
- **📄 Key Files**: requirements.txt, package.json, Dockerfile, etc.
- **🏗️ Project Structure**: File organization and architecture
- **🔗 Dependencies**: Installed packages and versions
- **⚙️ Configuration**: Environment and deployment settings

## 🛠️ **Behind the Scenes**

The unified chat:
1. **Initializes** with your repository path
2. **Analyzes** repository structure and content
3. **Detects** language, framework, and dependencies
4. **Reads** key configuration files
5. **Builds** comprehensive context for the AI
6. **Starts** conversational interface
7. **Maintains** context throughout the conversation

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Effective Conversations**
- Be specific about what you want to achieve
- Ask follow-up questions for clarification
- Request code examples when needed
- Ask for step-by-step instructions for complex tasks

### **Example Workflows**
```
# Security Review Workflow
"Check my code for security issues"
→ "How do I fix the SQL injection vulnerability?"
→ "Show me secure code examples"
→ "What other security best practices should I follow?"

# Performance Optimization Workflow  
"How can I improve performance?"
→ "Explain the database optimization suggestions"
→ "Show me how to implement caching"
→ "What monitoring should I add?"

# Deployment Workflow
"Help me deploy this application"
→ "Create a production-ready Dockerfile"
→ "What CI/CD pipeline should I use?"
→ "How do I handle environment variables?"
```

## 🔄 **Migration from Old CLI**

If you were using the old separate commands:

| **Old Command** | **New Unified Approach** |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| `analyze` | "Analyze my code for issues" |
| `suggest` | "What improvements do you suggest?" |
| `check_deps` | "Check my dependencies" |
| `fix_code` | "Help me fix this error: [error]" |
| `security` | "Are there any security vulnerabilities?" |
| `containerize` | "Help me containerize this app" |

## 🎉 **Benefits of Unified Approach**

✅ **Simpler**: One command to start, natural conversation  
✅ **Smarter**: AI has full context from the beginning  
✅ **Faster**: No need to run separate analysis commands  
✅ **Better**: Conversational flow with follow-up questions  
✅ **Integrated**: All development tasks in one interface  
✅ **Contextual**: AI remembers previous parts of conversation  

## 📝 **Quick Reference**

```bash
# Start unified chat
uv run python chat.py --repo-path .

# Windows shortcut
.\chat.bat

# With session saving
uv run python chat.py --repo-path . --save-session session.json

# Common conversation starters
"What issues do you see in my code?"
"How can I improve this application?"
"Help me containerize this project"
"What dependencies am I missing?"
"Are there security vulnerabilities?"
"How do I optimize for production?"
"Explain how to deploy this"
```
