### Example Conversations

#### Code Analysis
```
You: analyze my Python code for security issues

DevO: I'll analyze your Python code for security vulnerabilities...

[Detailed analysis with specific recommendations]
```

#### Dependency Help
```
You: deps check what's missing in my requirements.txt

DevO: Scanning your requirements.txt and imports...

Found several missing dependencies:
- requests (used in app.py line 5)
- flask-cors (used in app.py line 12)
- python-dotenv (used in config.py line 3)

Would you like me to generate an updated requirements.txt?
```

#### Containerization Assistance
```
You: containerize this Flask app for production

DevO: I'll help you containerize your Flask application...

[Step-by-step Docker setup with security best practices]
```

#### Performance Optimization
```
You: suggest performance improvements for my code

DevO: Based on your codebase analysis, here are performance optimizations...

[Specific recommendations with code examples]
```

## Features in Detail

### üîç **Context-Aware Analysis**
- Automatically loads repository context when started with `--repo-path`
- Analyzes file structure, languages, and frameworks
- Reads key configuration files (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
- Provides relevant suggestions based on detected technologies

### üí¨ **Conversational Interface**
- Natural language processing for developer queries
- Maintains conversation context across the session
- Supports follow-up questions and clarifications
- Provides detailed explanations with code examples

### üìù **Session Management**
- Optional session saving with `--save-session`
- Chat history persistence
- Repository context preservation
- Timestamped conversation records

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Analysis**
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security best practices
- Configuration security review
- Secrets detection and handling

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- Code efficiency analysis
- Resource usage optimization
- Scalability recommendations
- Performance monitoring suggestions

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (required)

### API Key Setup
```bash
# Set environment variable
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Or create .env file
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Commands
```bash
# Run multiple commands in sequence
echo -e "analyze\ndeps\nsecurity\nexit" | uv run python chat.py --repo-path .
```

### Custom Focus Areas
```bash
# Focus on specific aspects
You: analyze my code focusing on security and performance
```

### Integration with CI/CD
```bash
# Generate reports for CI/CD pipeline
uv run python chat.py --repo-path . --save-session < analysis_commands.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**
   ```
   ‚ùå API key required. Set GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
   ```
   **Solution**: Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable or create a `.env` file

2. **Repository Context Error**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not analyze repository context
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure the repository path exists and contains readable files

3. **Import Errors**
   ```
   ImportError: cannot import name 'xyz' from 'utils'
   ```
   **Solution**: Run `uv sync` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### Performance Tips

1. **Large Repositories**: The chat analyzes only the first 10 code files to avoid token limits
2. **File Size Limits**: Individual files are truncated to 5000 characters for analysis
3. **Context Optimization**: Only key configuration files are loaded for context

## Examples

### Security Audit
```
You: security audit my web application

DevO: I'll perform a comprehensive security audit of your web application...

üîç Security Analysis Results:

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Flask 1.1.0 has known security issues (CVE-2021-23385)
   - Recommendation: Update to Flask 2.3.0+

2. **Code Security Issues**
   - app.py line 45: SQL injection vulnerability
   - config.py line 12: Hardcoded secret key
   - auth.py line 78: Missing input validation

3. **Configuration Security**
   - Debug mode enabled in production
   - CORS configured too permissively
   - Missing security headers

Would you like me to provide specific fixes for these issues?
```

### Performance Optimization
```
You: optimize my database queries

DevO: I'll analyze your database queries for optimization opportunities...

üöÄ Performance Optimization Recommendations:

1. **Query Optimization**
   - models.py line 23: N+1 query problem detected
   - Recommendation: Use select_related() or prefetch_related()

2. **Indexing**
   - Missing index on frequently queried fields
   - Recommendation: Add database indexes

3. **Caching**
   - No caching strategy implemented
   - Recommendation: Implement Redis caching

Would you like me to show you the specific code changes?
```

## Next Steps

1. **Try the Chat**: Start with `uv run python chat.py --repo-path .`
2. **Explore Commands**: Type `help` to see all available commands
3. **Save Sessions**: Use `--save-session` to keep conversation history
